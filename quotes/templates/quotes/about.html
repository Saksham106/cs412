  <h2>About Socrates</h2>
  <p>Socrates (469 – 399 BCE) was a classical Greek philosopher, often 
     considered the founder of Western philosophy. He is best known for 
     his method of questioning—now called the Socratic Method—which 
     encouraged critical thinking and dialogue. Though he left no writings 
     of his own, his ideas were recorded by students like Plato. Socrates 
     emphasized the pursuit of virtue and self-knowledge, famously declaring 
     that “the unexamined life is not worth living.”</p>
